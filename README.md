#Leave Management System - C# ASP.NET

Leave Management System (C# ASP.NET)
The Leave Management System (C# ASP.NET) is a powerful web application developed to effectively manage employee leave requests within an organization. The back end of this application is built using C# ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework), and it utilizes MSSQL for the database. Below, we provide an overview of the project and instructions for running it on your local machine.

Project Overview
This comprehensive web application streamlines the entire leave request process, allowing employees to submit requests and managers to review and approve or reject them. An admin panel is also provided for managing user roles and leave policies. The core of this system is an MSSQL database, which securely stores user information, leave requests, and other essential data.

Technologies Used
C# ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework): The backbone of the application, providing a robust and extensible framework for building the back end.
C#: The primary programming language used to develop the back end logic of the application.
MSSQL: The database management system employed for creating and managing the database schema and storing data.
Running the Project Locally
To run this project on your local machine, please follow these steps:

Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using your preferred Git client.

Ensure that you have the necessary components installed, including the .NET Framework, ASP.NET, and MSSQL Server. If not, you can download them from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download and https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads, respectively.

Set up an MSSQL database where the application can store its data. You can use a local SQL Server instance or a cloud-based solution.

Configure the database connection in the project. Typically, this involves modifying a connection string in the application's configuration files.

Build and run the application using your preferred integrated development environment (IDE) for C#, such as Visual Studio.

Open a web browser and navigate to the appropriate URL to access the application.
